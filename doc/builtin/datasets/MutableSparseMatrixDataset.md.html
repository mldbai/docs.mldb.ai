<h1>Mutable Sparse Matrix Dataset</h1>

<p>The Sparse Matrix Dataset is used to store high cardinality sparse data.
It provides a reasonable baseline performance over all data types,
cardinalities and data shapes.</p>

<p>It is designed for the following situations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Datasets with up to millions of rows.</li>
<li>Datasets with up to millions of columns.</li>
<li>Data that is very sparse to dense</li>
<li>To store discrete values, or continuous values</li>
</ul>

<p>This dataset type is mutable, and only keeps its data in memory.  Saving
and loading will come in a future iteration.</p>

<p>The dataset is transactional.  Each row or set of rows will atomically
become visible on commit.</p>

<p>The dataset is fully indexed.  It can efficiently perform both row and
column based operations, as well as be transposed.</p>

<p>The dataset can store atomic types.  Rows will be flattened upon storage.</p>

<p>Each string based value is only stored once, so longer value like strings
can be stored, and the same value may be in many columns at once.</p>

<p>This is an experimental dataset.  It is not guaranteed to remain available
or compatible across releases.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p><p>A new dataset of type <code>sparse.mutable</code> named <code>&lt;id&gt;</code> can be created as follows:</p><pre><code class="language-python">mldb.put(&quot;/v1/datasets/&quot;+&lt;id&gt;, {
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;sparse.mutable&quot;,
    &quot;params&quot;: {
        "timeQuantumSeconds": &lt;float&gt;,
        "consistencyLevel": &lt;WriteTransactionLevel&gt;,
        "favor": &lt;TransactionFavor&gt;
    }
})</code></pre><p>with the following key-value definitions for <code>params</code>:</p><table class="params table" width='100%'><tr><th align='right'>Field, Type, Default</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td align='right'><p><strong>timeQuantumSeconds</strong> <br/> <nobr>float</nobr> <br/> <code>1.0</code></p></td><td><p>a number that controls the resolution of timestamps stored in the dataset, in seconds. 1 means one second, 0.001 means one millisecond, 60 means one minute. Higher resolution requires more memory to store timestamps.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'><p><strong>consistencyLevel</strong> <br/> <nobr>WriteTransactionLevel</nobr> <br/> <code>"consistentAfterCommit"</code></p></td><td><p>Transaction level for reading of written values.  In the default level, which is <code>consistentAfterCommit</code>, a value is only guaranteed to be readable after a commit (so it may seem like data is being lost if read before a commit) but writes are fast. With the <code>consistentAfterWrite</code> level, a written value can immediately be read back but writes are slower.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td align='right'><p><strong>favor</strong> <br/> <nobr>TransactionFavor</nobr> <br/> <code>"favorReads"</code></p></td><td><p>Whether to favor reads or writes.  Only has effect for when <code>consistencyLevel</code> is set to <code>consistentAfterWrite</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>The <code>consistencyLevel</code> values are as follows:</p>

<p><h4>Enumeration <code>WriteTransactionLevel</code></h4><table class="params table"><tr><th>Value</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>consistentAfterWrite</code></td><td><p>A value written will be available immediately after writing.  This provides the most consistency as operations are serializable, at the expense of slower writes and reads.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>consistentAfterCommit</code></td><td><p>A value written will only be guaranteed to be available after a `commit()` call has returned successfully, and may not be readable until that point.  This provides much faster write performance and should be used in any batch insertion scenario.</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>The <code>favor</code> values are as follows:</p>

<p><h4>Enumeration <code>TransactionFavor</code></h4><table class="params table"><tr><th>Value</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><code>favorReads</code></td><td><p>Values will be written in an indexed manner that favors read speed over write speed.  This will reduce the write volume, but make reads fast.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>favorWrites</code></td><td><p>Values will be written quickly in a non-indexed manner that favors write speed over read speed.  Values written will still be readable, but reads may take longer as there are no indexes maintained on recent writes.</td></tr>
</table></p>

<h2>Committing</h2>

<p>The dataset is transactional, which means that each record operation will
atomically become visible once it&#39;s completed.</p>

<p>It is better to record to the dataset in chunks of 1000 to 100,000 rows
at a time to avoid having too many separate, individually visible
chunks of data available at any one time.</p>

<p>The <code>commit</code> operation will cause the dataset to optimize its internal
storage for maximum query speed.  This should be used once the entire
dataset has been recorded or infrequently during recording.  Note that
the commit operation can take several seconds on a large dataset and
will block all writes (but not reads) while it&#39;s taking place (the
writes will end up completing once the commit operation is done).</p>
